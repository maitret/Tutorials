Social Plugins
============

The most basic use of the Facebook API comes in the form of adding Facebook Social
Plugins.

Facebook currently has the following social plugins:

* Like Button
* Share Button
* Subscribe Button
* Comments
* Activity Feed
* Recommendations
* Like Box
* Login Button
* Registration
* Facepile
* Live Stream

Facebook provides interactive builders for these plugins.

The developer docs for the social plugins are available at the
following url: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/

Plugins for Consideration
===========================

Given the assesment description, I would recommend, at a minimum, having a look
into the following plugins.

For those of you who are more adventureous, it is worth noting that Facebook is
an OpenID provider. This means that you can allow people to log-in to your site
via their existing Facebook account.

You can also integrate more directly with Facebook by following this guide: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/web/#login.
It describes how to use Facebook as your authentication layer. It also describes
how you can then gain access to additional user permissions. If you did integrate
more heavily with Facebook, you would be able to, for example, post directly to
a user's wall (without user interaction).

Like Button
--------------

The like button is similar to twitter's tweet button. The like button allows
users to share your webpage with their Facebook friends.

See http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like/ for
more information.

Comments
------------

The comments plugin allows users to leave comments about the content on a page.

See http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/comments/ for more
information.


Live Stream
--------------

The live stream allows users to discuss an event in real-time. This may be
useful for discussing the unfolding events of a traffic-jam (or alike).

See http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/live-stream/ for
more information.
